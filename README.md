Exam for Web 3 full stack

This was my exam hand in for web 3. This project has a simple backend to handle CRUD, connected to MongoDB for data storage and a simple React frontend. As I struggled a lot with
obscure bugs on the backend I didnt have enough time to finish up the frontend, hence why most of it looks smudged and unfinished.
